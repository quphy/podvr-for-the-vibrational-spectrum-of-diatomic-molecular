Use sine-podvr to find the vibrational spectrum of diatomic molecules. The implementation of podvr has been encapsulated into a module, and the specific diatomic reduced mass and potential energy curve settings can be performed through main.f90. Here is a demonstration example of using Morse potential to find the vibrational spectrum of hydrogen molecules in main.f90.
Thanks to my good friend Yunting Bu for communicating and discussing this project with me
