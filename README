Use sine-podvr to find the vibrational spectrum of diatomic molecules. The implementation of podvr has been encapsulated into a module, and the specific diatomic reduced mass and potential energy curve settings can be performed through main.f90. Here is a demonstration example of using Morse potential energy to find the vibrational spectrum of hydrogen molecules in main.f90.
